A pair of gloves and each finger has a flex sensor attached to it.
Arduino is connected with these gloves.
Now these smart gloves can be used in gaming applications or in even VR/AR applications.

For example, we can change TV channels with just a swipe in air.

For example, in games such as shooting users can experience a whole new level of gameplay.
